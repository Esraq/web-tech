							 Puthia Palace

							<p>
							Puthia is about 28km east of Rajshahi town and is connected to the Rajshahi-Natore highway by a 200m stretch of feeder road towards the south. This derelict but imposing palace faces the ‘Dol-Mancha’ temple across a large meadow to the north presenting a projection on each of its eastern and western ends. Its central part, which is about 15m wide, has an imposing portal in front. The building has two other smaller projections on either end and a further inset at the rear. A 3 meter wide verandah runs along the front of the block and provides access to some large halls behind. The balcony roof is supported on three graceful semi-Corinthian round and fluted columns which reach up to the upper storey. The central part of the building is relieved with a triangular pediment and the parapet is tastefully decorated with floral plasterwork. A broad wooden staircase, which is built into the eastern end of the verandah, provides access to the upper storey. Each projecting end of the edifice is relieved with four semi-Corinthian columns. A bilingual inscription fixed over the portal records its construction in 1895 by Rani Hemanta Kumari Devi. There are to be seen a few more out-buildings in its premise, all being built in the same period.
