							This fabulously embellished temple situated about 19.32km north of Dinajpur town. Maharaja Pran Nath built it in 1752. It was originally a Navaratna (nine- towered) temple. Every inch of its surface is lavishly decorated with different scenes as described in the two Hindu Great Epics, various Hindu divinities, contemporary social life and floral cum geometric motifs.One can start his journey for the monument from Dinajpur town or Sayedpur Airport by any kind of motorized vehicle.
							How to go

                            The temple is about a 1 mile west of Dinajpur-Thakurgaon Highway across the Dhepa River. Various types of communications like Bus, Motor bike and Rickshaw van can get you there within hours from the Town. You have to get off the bus at the Place called ‘Kantanagar’, if you choose to walk and enjoy the country atmosphere. However the journey will be a little lengthy, if you go there by Auto rickshaw.

Ram Sagar Rest house (telph. 0531-65558) located 6km south of the town at Ram Sagar tank will be an awesome place for nature lovers, but no food is available there. You will have to arrange by yourself. Privately held Diamond Hotel(telepone.0531-64629) is renowned for its wide accommodation facilities.
