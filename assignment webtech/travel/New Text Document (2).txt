The place does not have modern tourist facilities but tourists mostly enjoy the nature and culture of the place. Though the valley is in Rangamati but to tourists prefer the route from Kagrachari to Sajek valley through Dighinala Bazaar, Bagaihat Bazaar and Machalong Haat. Major transport is Chander Gari which is like a four wheel jeep. Tourists can also go to Sajek from Rangamati by engine vessel. It takes 5–6 hours in that route.[1]

		Nijhum Dwip (Bengali: ????? ?????, lit. 'Silent Island')[1] is a small island under Hatiya upazila. It is situated in Noakhali District in Bangladesh. Once it was called Char Osmani,Baluar Char, Golden Island [2]

A cluster of islands (mainly, Ballar Char, Kamlar Char, Char Osman and Char Muri) emerged in the early 1950s as an alluvium in the shallow estuary of the Bay of Bengal on the south of Noakhali. These new sandbanks first drew the notice of a group of fishermen, who named it Baular Char (literally, the alluvium of sand) later transformed into Ballar Char. Occupying an area of 14,050 acres (5,686 hectares), the island is situated between 21 0 1 / to 22 0 6 /North latitude and 90 0 3 / to 91 0 4 / East longitude
