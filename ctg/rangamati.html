							Rangamati was a contesting ground for the kings of Tripura and Arakan. This region came under the Mughal Empire after the Muslim invasion in 1566.[3] In 1737 Sher Mosta Khan, a tribal leader, took refuge with the Mughals. After this the Chakma settlement began along with various other settlements of varying ethnicity.[3] From 1760 to 1761, this land was leased to the East India Company.[3]

Picking fruits and vegetables early in the morning is a major trade here. They are not fluent in Bengali but the young population speak English confidently. 
						     Sajek was unexplored for a long time and recently it emerged as a tourist spot for itâ€™s outstanding natural beauty. The place does not have modern tourist facilities but tourists mostly enjoy the nature and culture of the place. Though the valley is in Rangamati but to tourists prefer the route from Kagrachari to Sajek valley through Dighinala Bazaar, Bagaihat Bazaar and Machalong Haat.
